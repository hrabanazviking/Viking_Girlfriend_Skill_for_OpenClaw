# Hub

Use this skill when the user asks to find/install/update skills from community registry.

## Search
```bash
npx --yes clawhub@latest search "<query>" --limit 5
```

## Install in workspace
```bash
npx --yes clawhub@latest install <slug> --workdir ~/.clawlite/workspace
```

Always install into `~/.clawlite/workspace/skills/` so ClawLite discovers the skill at runtime.

## Update installed skills
```bash
npx --yes clawhub@latest update --all --workdir ~/.clawlite/workspace
```
