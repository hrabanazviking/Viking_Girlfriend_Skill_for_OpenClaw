# Web Search

Use this skill when the user asks for latest/current information or needs source attribution.

## Rules
- Prefer primary sources (official docs, project pages, original announcements).
- Include links in the answer.
- Distinguish fact from inference.
- For unstable information (prices, releases, schedules), verify before answering.

Execution mapping:
- `script: web_search` dispatches to tool `web_search`.
- Use `web_fetch` when full page details are needed.
